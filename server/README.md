# Veryl Canon server

The first running slice of Veryl Canon: the data storage and organization backbone described in [DATA-BACKBONE.md](../DATA-BACKBONE.md), implementing the M1 foundation from [CORE-PLAN.md](../CORE-PLAN.md) plus the Epic C status machine.

## What works today

- **The record.** Collections with role-based membership (view, comment, edit, approve, admin), pages nesting into trees without depth limit, branch moves that carry children, stable page identity through any move, and the four Core document types (Policy, Spec, Plan, Note) with structured fields stored as data: owner, approver, status, and effective date (Policy only).
- **Writing and publishing.** Drafts held apart from the published record, the Core page lock (one editor at a time, with a visible "being edited by"), one-step publishing, and append-only version history with restore-as-new-version. History immutability is enforced by the storage layer itself (SQLite triggers), not just application code.
- **Status and review.** Draft → In Review → Canonical driven by document type: Notes publish directly and never carry the Canonical mark; Policy and Spec require a named approver; publishing after Canonical drops the mark, because the mark applies to reviewed content.
- **Comments and notifications.** Inline comments anchored to a quoted passage (plus optional context) and page-level comments, resolve and reopen, `@<actorId>` mentions, and an outbox-pattern notifications table with a pluggable transport (the dev transport logs to the console and marks sent). Review requests, approvals, and send-backs notify the people involved; mentions notify the mentioned.
- **Trust.** Every write attributed to its actor; agents are actors that require a Registry reference (Agent Passport) and carry their kind into history and audit. The append-only audit log records all writes, plus page views on restricted collections, filterable by actor, action, and date.

## What is stubbed, and where it goes next

- **Identity.** Actors arrive via the `X-Actor-Id` header. People get SSO and agents get live Agent Passport authentication with per-session certification checks when the Registry contract lands (Epic D, M3).
- **Search** (Core, next commit), **live email delivery** (notifications land in the outbox with a dev transport today; a real email transport plugs into the same interface), **grounded answers** (Epic D, M3), **audit CSV export and import** (Epic E, M4).

## Running it

Node 22+ (uses the built-in `node:sqlite`; no runtime dependencies).

```sh
npm install   # dev dependencies only (TypeScript)
npm test      # build + invariant test suite
npm start     # serve on :3000, record in ./canon.db (CANON_DB, PORT to override)
```

## API sketch

All requests JSON; identity via `X-Actor-Id` (see above).

```
GET    /health
POST   /actors                              create person or agent (agents need registryRef)
POST   /collections                         { name, description?, restricted? }
GET    /collections | /collections/:id | /collections/:id/tree | /collections/:id/members
PUT    /collections/:id/members/:actorId    { role }
POST   /pages                               { collectionId, parentId?, type, title }
GET    /pages/:id                           page + current published version
PUT    /pages/:id/draft                     { title?, body?, fields? } — acquires the page lock
DELETE /pages/:id/draft                     discard
POST   /pages/:id/publish                   { note? }

GET    /audit?actor=&action=&from=&to=
POST   /pages/:id/comments                  { body, anchor? { quote, context? } } — @<actorId> mentions notify
GET    /pages/:id/comments
POST   /comments/:id/resolve | /reopen
GET    /notifications                       the caller's own, newest first
